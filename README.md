# Trip-Advisor_WPF

For the app to work properly, the directory with the executable file should contain the following files:
- **TripAdvisor.deps**
- **TripAdvisor.dll**
- **TripAdvisor.pdb**
- **TripAdvisor.runtimeconfig**
and an additional folder named **Resources** containing the photos used within the application.
